## What next?

You learned some useful ways to combine the blocks you have learned about to make a game, including:
+ Using `forever`{:class="block3control"} block with `if`{:class="block3control"} statements to detect important **conditions** in your game and take action,
+ Broadcasting a `start`{:class="block3control"} message after setting up your character so everything is ready when you start the game,
+ Broadcasting a `stop`{:class="block3control"} message when you detect a game end **condition** such as winning or losing so that other script can stop and you can play a sound or do an animation before `stop [all]`{:class="block3control"}.
