## Introduction

In this project, you will design and create a top-down view obstacle or platform parkour game. Your character will need to jump, hop, glide, bounce or fly to catch a ride on moving platforms and make it to the other side.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**top-down/birds-eye view games**</span> look down on the game from above. Sometimes the whole game has this view, other games use top-down views when you enter a design mode. Can you think of any games you play that use top-down view? 
</p>

You will:
+ Make a game with a goal
+ Personalize a game to your interests
+ Adjust the difficulty of a game so that it’s fun to play

### Try it 

Click the space bar or tap the Stage to jump to the next platform. Time your jumps so you don't fall in the custard.

How does the game create a top-down view? How does the character's size change when it flies? What happens if you don’t land on a platform? (Go on, do fall in the custard!)

### Get inspiration 

You are going to make some design decisions to make a top-down platform game of your own. You'll choose the theme, colours, character, number of platforms and the difficulty level.
