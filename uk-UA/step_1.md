## What you will make

Design and build a top-down view, obstacle or platform, parkour game. Your character will need to jump, hop, glide, bounce, or fly to catch a ride on moving platforms and make it to the end.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Top-down/bird's-eye view games**</span> look down on the game from above. Sometimes the whole game has this view. Other games use top-down views when you enter a design mode. Can you think of any games you play that use top-down view?

### Play

Click the space bar or tap the Stage to jump to the next platform. Time your jumps so you don't fall in the custard.

+ How does the game create a top-down view? 
+ How does the character's size change when it flies? 
+ What happens if you donâ€™t land on a platform? (Go on, do fall in the custard!)

### Get ideas ðŸ’­

You are going to make some design decisions to make a top-down platform game of your own. You'll choose the theme, colours, character, number of platforms, and the difficulty level.
