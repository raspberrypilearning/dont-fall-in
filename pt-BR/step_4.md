You're going to add a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop that checks if your **character** is at platform level, and if so, `if`{:class="block3control"} it has reached the **End** platform.

**Choose:** Add a winning sound to your character.

Add code to detect when your character reaches the **End** platform using `touching color`{:class="block3sensing"}.

title: End the game when touching colour

**Character**:

```blocks3
when I receive [start v]
forever
if <(size) = (landed)> then // not in the air
if <touching color (#b89d2f) ?> then // at end
broadcast (stop v) // stop other sprites
stop [other scripts in sprite v] // stop jumping after win
go to (End v)
play sound (Win v) until done
stop [all v]
end
end
end
```

It's a good idea to `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} a 'stop' message to let other sprites know the game has ended. The `stop other scripts in sprite`{:class="block3control"} block stops the loop that makes the character jump.

You will need to set the colour that is sensed to the colour of your **End** platform.

**Tip:** It's a good idea to `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} a `stop`{:class="block3events"} message when you detect that your game is finished so that other sprites can stop, but this sprite can do something such as playing a sound before it stops.

**Test:** Click the green flag and then jump your character across the Stage. Make sure you hear the winning sound when you reach the **End** platform.

**Tip:** It's really important that you test your project before moving to the next step and adding more code. It's harder to find and fix bugs when you have added more code.

You need to make sure all your sprite costumes are centered in the Paint editor.

The `go to (other sprite)`{:class="block3motion"} block moves a sprite so that it's centre is in the same position as the centre of the other sprite. If their centres are in the wrong place, then your **character** won't go to the centre of the platforms.

title: The game ends too soon

Check that your sprite isn't touching the End colour when it's not on the **End** platform â€” if you use the same colour elsewhere in your project, then your character could die too soon.

title: The sound doesn't play when I land on the End platform
---

Click on your **character** sprite and then the 'Sounds' tab. Make sure you have added the End sound to your sprite. Click on the **Play** button to make sure sound is working on your computer.

Click on the **Code** tab and check that the correct sound is in the `play sound`{:class="block3sound"} block that runs when the sprite reaches the **End** platform.

Make sure the colour is correct in the `touching colour`{:class="block3sensing"} block. Select it again if you're not sure. Sometimes colours look similar but aren't the same.

```blocks3
when I receive [start v]
forever
if < (size) = (landed) > then // not in the air
+if <touching color (#b89d2f) ?> then // at end
broadcast (stop v) // stop other sprites
go to (End v)
+play sound (Win v) until done
stop [all v]
end
end
end
```

If you have a bug that we haven't covered here, then let us know in the feedback. If you fixed the bug yourself (well done!), let us know that too.

**Tip:** If you're stuck, try reading your code out loud or in your head to make sure it says what you think it does. You might find the bug.
